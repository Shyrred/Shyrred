### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Shyrred/Shyrred** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a Django REST API
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning webdev, advanced POO and APIs
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : Twitter (in bio) / Discord (Shyred #5138)
- âš¡Feel free to provide feedback on any possible improvment on my public repos and I will review it.âš¡
